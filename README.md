## Image-Classification-using-SVM

# 1.	Introduction
The project demonstrate application of SVM’s in image classification. The model differentiates 26 English alphabets based on different statistical attributes such as width, height etc.
# 2.	Data Collection:

The dataset contains 20,000 examples of 26 English alphabet capital letters as printed using 20 different black and white fonts.

# 3.	Summary
The model shows that SVM’s are capable of learning complex patterns while being able to avoid noise in the data. They are able to understand visual patterns with a high degree of accuracy. 
The model was able to predict the letters correctly with a 97.05% accuracy.
